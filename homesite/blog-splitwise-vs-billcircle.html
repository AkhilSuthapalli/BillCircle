        <h1>Bill Circle vs. <span>Splitwise</span></h1>

        <p class="subtitle">
            Splitwise is a mature tool, but maturity often brings complexity.
            Bill Circle was built for users who want to split expenses
            fast, privately, and without the friction of mandatory accounts.
        </p>

        <div class="features">
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Link-First Access</h3>
                <p>Skip the onboarding. Create a circle and share a secure, non-guessable link instantly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Privacy by Design</h3>
                <p>No public profiles, no contact list imports, and no searchable users. Your data stays yours.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Zero Friction</h3>
                <p>Anyone with the link can participate. No sign-ups, no passwords, and no app downloads.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Lowering Cognitive Load</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Splitwise focuses on long-term tracking and friend networks.
            Bill Circle focuses on the core tasks: Add members, log expenses, see who owes whom, and lock the record when done.
        </p>

        <div class="platforms">
            <div class="platform">Instant Setup</div>
            <div class="platform">Minimal Friction</div>
            <div class="platform">Privacy-First</div>

        </div>

        <h3>Optimized for Temporary Groups</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Trips, dinners, and hackathons are temporary. Once settled, you can lock your
            circle to freeze the results and preserve the final balance forever.
